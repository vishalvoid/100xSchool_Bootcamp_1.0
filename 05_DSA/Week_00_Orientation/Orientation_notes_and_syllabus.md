### Course Overview

- Course duration: 6-8 months, with potential adjustments based on class pace and student understanding
- Weekly classes: Thursday evenings, 8:00-10:30 PM, approximately 2-2.5 hours per session
- Focus: Interview preparation for DSA, not competitive programming (CP)
- Topics covered include all important concepts for interviews
- Course is language agnostic - can be followed in any programming language (C++, Java, Python, JavaScript)
- No prerequisites required; course starts from scratch
- Suitable for beginners, including first-year students

### Language Recommendations

- For DSA learning, recommended languages: C++, Java, Python, or JavaScript
- Golang is not recommended as there aren't many people in the DSA community using it
- Java is slightly slower than C++ but won't impact learning or problem-solving
- For beginners without Java experience but interested due to Spring Boot, C++ is recommended

### Contest Recommendations for Experienced Learners

- **Codeforces**: Div 3 and Div 4 contests
- **AtCoder**: Beginner Contest (ABC)
- **LeetCode**: Weekly and bi-weekly contests
- These recommendations are only for students who already have fundamental DSA knowledge and want to level up
- Contest problems have time limits (typically 2 hours), but assignments do not

### Balancing DSA with Other Skills

- Recommended maximum: Focus on 2 areas at a time (e.g., Web Dev + DSA or AI + DSA)
- For beginners: Start with Web Dev and DSA together
- For working professionals: Follow the course and participate in LeetCode weekly/bi-weekly contests every weekend
- Minimum time commitment: 1-2 hours daily
- Students with 10 hours daily can go all in on both areas

### Revision Strategy and Resources

- Revision sheet provided (Excel format) for tracking problems
- Students can create their own copy: File → Make a copy
- Revision schedule: Every weekend, review problems marked for revisit
- Strategy: Filter for "revisit" problems, solve them, and update status to "no" when comfortable
- Do not delete entries from the revision sheet
- For students with prior knowledge: Can watch previous cohort lectures to speed up learning

### Importance of Complete Coverage

- All topics in the curriculum are important for interviews - skipping advanced topics is not recommended
- Even if you secure a first job without mastering all DSA concepts, you may need them for future job switches
- Better to invest time upfront so you don't have to worry about it later
- Example: Kirat B spent first/second year on DSA/CP and never had to revisit it

### Real-World Applications of DSA

- **Comment System Example**: Building a nested comment system (up to 7 levels deep) requires tree data structures to store in SQL databases and handle collapse/expand functionality
- **Frontend Implementation**: Building nested comment components in React requires recursion - treating components as functions that call themselves recursively
- **LinkedIn Connections**: Connection degrees (1st, 2nd, 3rd connections) are calculated using graph algorithms
- **Notion Clone**: Building tools like Notion requires graph knowledge at core
- Real-world projects often combine DSA, database skills, and frontend development
- Instructor's personal example: Had to achieve 5-star rating on CodeChef before being assigned a complex project at Unacademy CodeChef internship

### Problem-Solving Approach

- Start with easy problems first - don't attempt the hardest problems immediately (gym weight analogy)
- On Codeforces, begin with lower-rated problems and gradually increase difficulty
- When stuck on a problem, use hints progressively rather than jumping directly to solutions
- After contests, spend time learning how to solve problems you couldn't complete during the contest
- Goal: Build intuition and problem-solving skills to tackle new problems, not just memorize solutions

### CP vs. DSA Focus

- CP is like JEE Advanced, DSA is like JEE Mains
- Most companies don't ask CP-level questions, but top-tier companies do
- This course focuses on interview preparation (DSA), not competitive programming
- A few CP classes can be added if there's sufficient student interest
- For DSA prep, LeetCode is more relevant than platforms like CSES (which is better for CP)

### Additional Resources and Tips

- No need for LeetCode premium subscription
- Course materials and problems will be sufficient
- Students who joined late: No coding will be taught in this session, actual learning starts next week
- Next session will cover C++ basics: printing, operators, conditionals, and solve basic problems

### Action Items

- [ ] &#x20;Create your own copy of the revision sheet (File → Make a copy)
- [ ] &#x20;Set up weekend revision routine for problems marked as "revisit"
- [ ] &#x20;Students with prior knowledge: Start participating in recommended contests (Codeforces Div 3/4, AtCoder ABC, LeetCode weekly/bi-weekly)
- [ ] &#x20;Working professionals: Commit to participating in LeetCode contests every weekend
- [ ] &#x20;Try building the nested comment component in React using recursion as practice
