# AI and ML Orientation Class - Summary Notes

**Instructor:** Rishabh  
**Role:** Research Engineer at Intelligence AI (San Francisco)  
**Background:** Published papers in ICML & NeurIPS, previously worked at Chinese AI lab

---

## Course Overview

### Main Goals

1. **Stay Updated** - Learn to follow the right sources as AI changes daily
2. **Understand Core Mechanics** - How LLMs actually work (intuition-first, minimal math)
3. **Applied AI Skills** - Build real-world AI applications and agents

### Two Learning Paths

- **Applied AI** (primary focus) - Building products, agents, and tools
- **Research/Theoretical AI** (optional classes) - Deep dives into papers and math

---

## What You'll Learn

### Theoretical Side

- History of AI → Transformers → Modern LLMs
- How models work internally (attention mechanisms, KV cache, optimizations)
- Paper reading sessions (Attention is All You Need, DeepSeek, etc.)
- Build a mini LLM from scratch (NanoLM project)

### Applied Side

- **Agent frameworks** (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.)
- **Context engineering** - How to pass data correctly to LLMs
- **Fine-tuning** techniques (LoRA, QLoRA, RLHF)
- **Multi-agent systems** and orchestration
- **MCP servers** and integrations
- **Memory systems** for persistent context

---

## Career & Job Prep

### What AI Engineers Do

- Essentially the "new backend engineers"
- Manage data pipelines to/from LLMs
- Choose appropriate models for tasks
- Build RAG systems, vector databases
- Orchestrate agents and workflows

### Interview Topics

Companies now ask:

- Intuitive questions about how LLMs work
- Loss functions (L1, L2)
- Model fundamentals
- Applied problem-solving with AI

---

## Prerequisites & Tools

### Before Starting

- **Basic Python** (loops, conditionals, functions)
- **Open mind** - That's it!

### Tools to Try

- **OpenCode** - Free CLI coding agent (uses GLM-4-Flash)
- **DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM** - Explore Chinese open-source models
- **Google Gemini** - Free API for students (1 year)

### Best Info Sources

- **Twitter** - Follow Anthropic, OpenAI, key researchers
- Most AI news breaks on Twitter first

---

## Key Frameworks & Concepts

### You'll Learn

- PyTorch (primary library for all coding)
- Transformer architecture from scratch
- Agent frameworks
- Hugging Face (GitHub for AI models)
- Kaggle competitions (optional)

### Hot Topics

- Agentic workflows
- Context engineering (biggest challenge right now)
- Reasoning models (DeepSeek R1, etc.)
- Vibe coding with AI assistants

---

## Project Ideas That Stand Out

Good projects involve:

- **Managing large datasets** (GitHub, Linear, Jira data)
- **Context management** - Passing data correctly to LLMs
- **Memory systems** - Persistent state across sessions
- Real problem-solving with practical applications

---

## Important Notes

- **Don't mix DSA + Web Dev + AI** - Pick one focus area
- If preparing for campus placements → Focus on DSA
- If targeting startups → AI + Web Dev is powerful combo
- Field changes weekly - staying updated is crucial
- Math will be kept minimal with strong intuitions

---

## What Makes This Different

- Intuition-first approach
- Real-world tools and workflows
- Industry-relevant skills (not just theory)
- Dynamic curriculum adapting to new developments
- Optional deep-dives for research-minded students

---

## Next Steps

1. Try OpenCode CLI tool
2. Explore open-source models (Qwen, DeepSeek)
3. Join Discord for polls on timing/content
4. Follow AI news on Twitter
5. **Next class:** History of AI → How we got to ChatGPT
